## Snap of the Emulator for the Commander X16 8-bit computer

[![Snap Status](https://build.snapcraft.io/badge/popey/x16emu-snap.svg)](https://build.snapcraft.io/user/popey/x16emu-snap) [![Commander X16 Emulator](https://snapcraft.io/x16emu/badge.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/x16emu)

This repo contains the build recipe to compile [x16-emulator](https://github.com/commanderx16/x16-emulator), [x16-roms](https://github.com/commanderx16/x16-rom.git). It uses [cc65](https://github.com/cc65/cc65) to build the x16-rom bundle.

This will build stable releases when upstream release new versions of the ROM and emulator. It also builds (~daily) 'edge' builds of master in both repositories. 

They're pushed to the edge channel in the store.
